—Gottlob Frege

**fregerator** is an automated theorem prover. It extends Frege's above quote. Calculation becomes deduction, and deduction becomes computation, just like [everything else](http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1612).

**fregerator is currently a work in progress and not suitable for production use.**
